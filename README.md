## Objectives and Features
The objective of this project is to print either the present month calendar or a choosen one and be able to change its colors by chosing both date and theme in a form. If the current month is the one displayed, current day display will be lightly different.

Actually was a mock application to joke with my mum but I would like to take it serious and refactor the code as well as add some features to it.

Some of these new features would be adding events or tasks and be able to update, delete and drag and drop them to change its date.
